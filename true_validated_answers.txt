ANSWER:                                                                                                                                                         
A monk commits an offense if they eat fresh or cooked food at the "wrong time," which is defined as the period from when the middle of the day has passed until 
dawn [CHAPTER pli-tv-bu-vb-pc37, CHAPTER pli-tv-bu-pm]. The Buddha and the mendicant Sa?gha abstain from eating at night because they find that doing so keeps t
hem "healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably" [CHAPTER mn70].                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                
However, there are exceptions. Being sick is considered an appropriate occasion to break other eating rules, such as eating in a group or eating meals in succes
sion [CHAPTER pli-tv-bu-pm]. For the rule about eating at the wrong time, there is no offense if a monk, when there is a reason, uses "post-midday tonics, seven
-day tonics, or lifetime tonics" [CHAPTER pli-tv-bu-vb-pc37]. Certain mixtures of these tonics are allowable after midday. For instance, seven-day tonics or lif
etime tonics mixed with post-midday tonics can be consumed after midday on the day they are received [CHAPTER pli-tv-kd6].
